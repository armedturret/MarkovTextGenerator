On restless nights my thoughts drift,
I wonder, "What am I?"
I am cells, compounds, molecules
A vast framework of finite pieces
But then I wonder, "What are they?"
They are atoms, protons, electrons
A satisfying answer for some, but not enough
Particles far smaller than would ever matter,
But I needed to know, "what makes them?"
They are quarks, gluons, muons
The question becomes an entrancing thought,
An infinite recursion of shirked explanation
There must be a conclusion
They are strings, vibrations, energy
And, at the very limit, they are nothing

I pause, a fear creeping into my mind's edge
"Surely not, there must be a definitive something"
For if at the end is nothing
Then what is energy, vibrations, strings?
Then what are muons, gluons, quarks?
Then what are electrons, protons, atoms?
Then what are molecules, compounds, cells?
Then what am I?
The logic must be wrong, I am something
I see, I feel, I think, I am
And when I leave there will be less
And so I wonder once more, "What am I?"
As on restless nights, my thoughts drift
